            I remember when I used to think good things would never happen for me and that no one could ever stand actually being with me. Now, I‚Äôve always thought that couples were the cringiest for these ‚Äúmonth-a-versarries‚Äù and I think I still do but like I said gooey couple stuff seems less sticky with you. Thank you for spending the last month encouraging, enduring and educating. It seems like the almost 4 months of agony I endured were worth it. Allow me to share a quote from the book I was telling you about last week. I think of it often whenever we‚Äôre on a date.

I agonized for weeks Caleb, weeks, I‚Äôd stare at you on the platform and like I told you I‚Äôd try pick out things to blow out of proportion to make me unlike you üòÇbut then we‚Äôd have these conversations or little things would happen like when I found out you liked Star Wars I surrendered and my prayers changed to be specifically about you. Help me find red flags in this brother or else prove to me that this is could last a lifetime and every time it was always the latter. So I took the plunge because I couldn‚Äôt keep praying for what was right in front of me. Then I started dating you. You know the sensation of falling and not being able to control it which is what happened with us and suddenly I was waking up and trying to think what it would be like if you were there too or looking up tiny homes and not freaking out about marriage and the future. I want those things with you.
