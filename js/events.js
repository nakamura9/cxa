When I started dating you I knew that this would work, something told me that but I didn‚Äôt know just how much of you I‚Äôd have in my heart. Thank for 10 absolutely wonderful months. I‚Äôll admit that last night I cried a little on the phone when I was telling you how much I wanted to live with you because I was so overwhelmed by how much I care about you, truthfully I‚Äôm a little teary now. This month‚Äôs message is a lot more emotional. I don‚Äôt want the possibility of us never being together, you‚Äôre my everything; you make me proud, you make me happy, you make me feel safe. I hope I‚Äôve given you just a fraction of that, I love you, thank for 10 months my gorgeous boy. I miss you terribly ‚ù§Ô∏è`

This month we finally spoke with your parents and I made a formal request for you, event though I'm wholly undeserving. I'm humbled by their kindness to me and your willingness to be my wife. We also put a deposit on a wedding venue! Everything began to feel so real and as a result 9 months began to feel unbearably far for me too. We got a bit of sticker shock here and there, but I'm excited to make you mine and the prospect of the joy I have in the few moments we can share at present growing exponentially is a giddy feeling. Ten months may not be 1 year, but in our relationship we'll look back at July for all it meant to us. I love you`

            <p>My sweet Althea,  </p>

                            <p>I thought after spending as much time as I do with you, I'd be better at expressing my affection for you. 

                                <br>I probably am. but this moment is so important, I don't think I would ever be good enough to express in words how much you mean to me. 
                                
                                <br>Maybe after a thousand years, but I can't wait that long. I love you. 
                                
                                <br>I love you for being Muse, my inspiration. I never had a suitable subject for poetry, until I started loving you. I never knew flowers and sunsets could move me, until I started comparing them to you, trying to evoke the same feelings I get when I gaze upon your beautiful face. 
                                
                                <br>I love you for being Althea, my healer. At a time when I was angry, and full of self-doubt and shame, you gently showed me that I can be loved and that I mean something.  
                                
                                <br>I love you for being Althea, wholesome. You're so completely beneficial, I've drawn so much strength and grown immensely after coming to love you. 
                            </p>
  

                            <p>
                                    Even with my best efforts, I know my conception contains fewer nouns than can accurately describe what you've come to mean for me.  

                                <br>I know that I say this all the time, but you've really given me a whole new perspective on forever. 

                                <br>The idea of being with you forever seems so deeply right to me, that I can no longer fathom any other reality. I want that to start today.  

                                <br><br>Althea, would you graciously accept a igneous rock encrusted on a band of gold alloy as a customary symbol of my undying love for you and my desire to begin our forever, together? 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before being with you I had my own ideas of what a suitable match would be, they'd be witty and funny. Spiritual and loving. It was a decent list, but it fell far short of what I have come to experience. 

                                <br>You're so much more than I could have imagined. That we share as much in common as we do astound me. That you've been as willing to put up with and even learn to enjoy my idiosyncrasies humbles me deeply.  

                                <br>That I could learn as much as I have from you never fails to amaze me. Althea, you come from Jehovah himself, of that I have no question. I am compelled to act because failure to do so would be to spurn his love. 

                                <br>The flame of Jah is present in both our hearts, that is clear. It blazes with intense heat, and I can't wait to contribute to its growth for eternity.  
                            </p>
                            <h1>Althea, <br> Will you marry me?</h1>
