                            <h1>From Like to Love</h1>
                            <p>I liked you because you knew the difference between an Ewok and a Wookie
                                <br>I liked you because you were smart, well-read and articulate
                                <br>I liked you because you were tall and slender and cut a striking figure from any angle.
                                <br>I liked you because of how your cheeks dimple when you smile.
                                </p>

                            <p>I liked how giddy I would feel at the mere idea of being with you. I love you for how intoxicating and addictive the reality turned out to be
                                <br>I liked you for calling yourself, and living up to the billing of being, "a cheap date"
                                <br>I loved you when you actually took me out on a date, and then again, and I loved you some more
                            </p>


                            <p>I love you because merely existing with you seems the most natural thing in the world 
                                <br>I love you for your modesty and quiet inner strength
                                <br>I love you because you fuss over me and relentlessly urge me to slow down, even though you might stand to benefit from my manic pursuits.
                                <br>I love how you take a genuine interest in what's important to me, even though really it should be important to no one.
                                <br>I love you because together we are more than the sum of our parts
                                <br>I love you that you taught me to pursue and never become the tired
                                <br>I love you because you never take for granted that I would love you.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I love you because you opened my eyes to the beauty in the natural world around me, if only to capture briefly the sensation of being in the physical presence of your beauty
                            <br>I love you because you make me want to live forever from a new perspective,  because I know every day with you holds endless promise

                            <br>I love you for how you hijack my brain during the workday, the smile that follows, and how complicit my thoughts become to that hijacking, surrendering with pleasure to the diversion.

                            <br>Lately though, I don't remember the last time I liked you, because lately, all I feel is intense love for you.
                            </p>

                            <h1>I hope it lingers</h1>
                            <p>
                                I’m not accustomed to writing about anything that isn’t a negative emotion
                                <br>But poetry is no longer my haven
                                <br>And that terrifies me
                                <br>I stumbled upon a new haven with a beating heart just like mine
                                <br>And my poems have become secondary
                                <br>Which isn’t to say sometimes I’m not on the verge of tears because I’m afraid of losing you Which I equate to losing everything
                                <br>It’s to say that instead of writing about that pain in my chest
                                <br>I’d rather cure it by being with you
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The thing about calling you a ‘haven’ is that I know you’d never hide me
                                <br>Instead you’d face everything with me
                                <br>And I’m not comfortable with the feeling of being temporary that the word ‘haven’ connotes
                                <br>Instead I’ll find a word for a person on which you rest all your burdens, never feeling like one
                                <br>A place where the seasons change but the weather is never gloomy
                                <br>I have a feeling that my shipwrecked soul finally reached the shore
                                <br><br>And I hope it lingers
                            </p>

                            <h1>Althea</h1>
                            <p>My sweet Althea,  </p>

                            <p>I thought after spending as much time as I do with you, I'd be better at expressing my affection for you. 

                                <br>I probably am. but this moment is so important, I don't think I would ever be good enough to express in words how much you mean to me. 
                                
                                <br>Maybe after a thousand years, but I can't wait that long. I love you. 
                                
                                <br>I love you for being Muse, my inspiration. I never had a suitable subject for poetry, until I started loving you. I never knew flowers and sunsets could move me, until I started comparing them to you, trying to evoke the same feelings I get when I gaze upon your beautiful face. 
                                
                                <br>I love you for being Althea, my healer. At a time when I was angry, and full of self-doubt and shame, you gently showed me that I can be loved and that I mean something.  
                                
                                <br>I love you for being Althea, wholesome. You're so completely beneficial, I've drawn so much strength and grown immensely after coming to love you. 
                            </p>
  

                            <p>
                                    Even with my best efforts, I know my conception contains fewer nouns than can accurately describe what you've come to mean for me.  

                                <br>I know that I say this all the time, but you've really given me a whole new perspective on forever. 

                                <br>The idea of being with you forever seems so deeply right to me, that I can no longer fathom any other reality. I want that to start today.  

                                <br><br>Althea, would you graciously accept a igneous rock encrusted on a band of gold alloy as a customary symbol of my undying love for you and my desire to begin our forever, together? 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before being with you I had my own ideas of what a suitable match would be, they'd be witty and funny. Spiritual and loving. It was a decent list, but it fell far short of what I have come to experience. 

                                <br>You're so much more than I could have imagined. That we share as much in common as we do astound me. That you've been as willing to put up with and even learn to enjoy my idiosyncrasies humbles me deeply.  

                                <br>That I could learn as much as I have from you never fails to amaze me. Althea, you come from Jehovah himself, of that I have no question. I am compelled to act because failure to do so would be to spurn his love. 

                                <br>The flame of Jah is present in both our hearts, that is clear. It blazes with intense heat, and I can't wait to contribute to its growth for eternity.  
                            </p>
