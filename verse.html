                            <p>I liked you because you knew the difference between an Ewok and a Wookie
                                <br>I liked you because you were smart, well-read and articulate
                                <br>I liked you because you were tall and slender and cut a striking figure from any angle.
                                <br>I liked you because of how your cheeks dimple when you smile.
                                </p>

<p>I liked how giddy I would feel at the mere idea of being with you. I love you for how intoxicating and addictive the reality turned out to be
    <br>I liked you for calling yourself, and living up to the billing of being, "a cheap date"
    <br>I loved you when you actually took me out on a date, and then again, and I loved you some more</p>


<p>I love you because merely existing with you seems the most natural thing in the world 
    <br>I love you for your modesty and quiet inner strength
    <br>I love you because you fuss over me and relentlessly urge me to slow down, even though you might stand to benefit from my manic pursuits.
    <br>I love how you take a genuine interest in what's important to me, even though really it should be important to no one.
    <br>I love you because together we are more than the sum of our parts
    <br>I love you that you taught me to pursue and never become the tired
    <br>I love you because you never take for granted that I would love you.
</p>
<p>
    I love you because you opened my eyes to the beauty in the natural world around me, if only to capture briefly the sensation of being in the physical presence of your beauty
<br>I love you because you make me want to live forever from a new perspective,  because I know every day with you holds endless promise

<br>I love you for how you hijack my brain during the workday, the smile that follows, and how complicit my thoughts become to that hijacking, surrendering with pleasure to the diversion.

<br>Lately though, I don't remember the last time I liked you, because lately, all I feel is intense love for you.

                            <h1>I hope it lingers</h1>
                            <p>
                                I’m not accustomed to writing about anything that isn’t a negative emotion
                                <br>But poetry is no longer my haven
                                <br>And that terrifies me
                                <br>I stumbled upon a new haven with a beating heart just like mine
                                <br>And my poems have become secondary
                                <br>Which isn’t to say sometimes I’m not on the verge of tears because I’m afraid of losing you Which I equate to losing everything
                                <br>It’s to say that instead of writing about that pain in my chest
                                <br>I’d rather cure it by being with you</p>

<p>
    The thing about calling you a ‘haven’ is that I know you’d never hide me
<br>Instead you’d face everything with me
<br>And I’m not comfortable with the feeling of being temporary that the word ‘haven’ connotes
<br>Instead I’ll find a word for a person on which you rest all your burdens, never feeling like one
<br>A place where the seasons change but the weather is never gloomy
<br>I have a feeling that my shipwrecked soul finally reached the shore
<br><br>And I hope it lingers
